      'Timing can completely change your experience. Early mornings are usually the calmest, with fewer visitors and clearer air for panoramic views. Late afternoons are perfect if you want to catch the golden hour, when the city is bathed in warm light. Sunset is the most popular time, offering a magical transition from day to night, but it also means more crowds. If you prefer a quieter experience, consider visiting on weekdays or during off-peak seasons.',
